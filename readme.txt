== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Scrollbars in blocks =
**Answer:** This happens if your ads are overflowing the allotted space. This means that you need to re-do the sizing of your ads. Perhaps remove or lessen the margin on them. Make the sidebar wider (or which ever area). Or use smaller ads all-together.

= Why do I get this error when I want to activate AdRotate? =
"Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '&amp;', expecting T_VARIABLE or '$' in /path/to/www/example.com/wp-content/plugins/adrotate/adrotate-manage.php on line 136"
 
**Answer:** Upgrade your server to use PHP5. Contact your webhost for more information.

= I'm getting errors about duplicate entries in the stats or the tracker table! =
**Answer:** This means your database is full and needs to be "upgraded". More on the how and why in [this article](href="http://www.adrotateplugin.com/support/knowledgebase/duplicate-entry-errors/)!

= Why do my ads not rotate when I reload the page? =
**Answer:** In most cases you have a cache plugin active. WP-Super Cache or something similar. AdRotate uses a static ad which means the ad will also be cached. AdRotate has basic compatibility with some caching plugins. Check out the AdRotate Settings.
